# Homework5WorkDaySched
The purpose of this application was to create a simple calendar app that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. We were given starter code and the app runs in the browser, features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. 

The main criteria that needed to be fulfilled included the current day being displayed on the top of the calendar, timeblocks being presented for each standard business hour, timeblocks being colorcoded to indicated whether the event is in the past, present or future, events being inputted and saved locallly using local storage and finally the saved event persists despite a refresh.

Overall this project was fairly straight forward and simple. The moment.js library was used to access date and time, time indicative (past, present, future) timeblocks were added to the html and finally events were saved locally and persist beyond a site refresh.
